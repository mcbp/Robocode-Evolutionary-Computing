# Robocode-Evolutionary-Computing
A Genetic programming solution to evolve generations of battle tanks using the Robocode API.

Robocode allows users to code their own robots which will battle each other in an arena.
Using the Robocode API, I created a genetic program to evolve robots that increase in ability from generation to generation.
The solution was implemented in Java and uses a fixed length solution as the structure for each chromosome that determines a robots functionality.

The program was tested with different configurations of mutation rate, tournament selection size, population size and generation size to find the optimum conditions to run the program under.
The results and java files of the best performing robot can be found in the robots folder.
